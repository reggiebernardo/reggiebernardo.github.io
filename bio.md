Hi, I'm Reggie and I hail from Calamba City, Philippines, where I went to high school and the seminary. After that, I pursued my passion for physics.

I received my scientific training (BS 2015, MS 2017, PhD 2020) from the prestigious [National Institute of Physics](http://nip.upd.edu.ph/) at the [University of the Philippines](https://upd.edu.ph/), where I earned my BS in 2015, MS in 2017, and PhD in 2020 (read more [here](https://www.flipscience.ph/news/features-news/features/reginald-bernardo-gravitational-physicist/), [here](https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/06/07/20/beyond-einstein-a-young-pinoy-physicist-shines-light-on-black-holes-dark-energy), [here](https://news.abs-cbn.com/ancx/culture/spotlight/06/21/20/the-first-pinoy-gravitational-physicist-on-whats-keeping-scientists-here-from-achieving-greater-heights), and [here](http://davaotoday.com/main/economy/education/a-hope-for-science-community-as-up-alum-becomes-phls-first-gravitational-physicist/), among others). During my time at the university, I had the privilege of being guided by two brilliant physicists: [Perry Esguerra](http://nip.upd.edu.ph/profiles/jose-perico-esguerra/) and [Ian Vega](https://ianvega.wixsite.com/ianvega/about). I later joined the [Gravity Group](https://gravity-nip.github.io/) and continued my research there.

Currently, I'm a postdoc at the [Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica](https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/index.php) in Taiwan, where I continue my research in theoretical cosmology and gravitational physics.

When I'm not working on physics, I enjoy playing chess and basketball, hiking, and having long conversations over drinks. I'm also a big fan of movies, TV series (shoutout to Mr. Robot fans!), and anime. Some of my all-time favorites include Whiplash (movie), Mr. Robot (TV series), The Office US (sitcom), and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (anime).
