### Research Statement

The current state of cosmology is characterized by a need for new theories and models that can address fundamental questions such as the nature of dark energy and the Hubble tension. As a cosmologist, I am passionate about exploring alternative theories of gravity that can shed light on these cosmic puzzles. My research focuses on the development of novel models that incorporate irreplaceable features of general relativity, such as gravitational waves, while also making testable predictions about astrophysical and cosmological phenomena. <br />

In particular, I am fascinated by the largely unexplored nanohertz regime for gravitational wave detection, which has the potential to reveal exotic phenomena such as cosmic strings and phase transitions. Additionally, I am interested in the applications of machine learning in cosmology and have been exploring the use of these techniques to analyze large datasets and extract meaningful insights. <br />

My research objectives include identifying interdisciplinary connections between cosmology and other areas of science and technology, staying up-to-date with the latest research in my areas of interest, and collaborating with other researchers to broaden my research scope and produce more impactful research. <br />

Overall, my goal is to contribute to the paradigm shift in cosmology by developing new theories and models that can address the fundamental questions and puzzles of the field. By working with others and staying informed about the latest research developments, I hope to make meaningful contributions to the field and help advance our understanding of the Universe.
