### As a Physics Teacher

Physics is fun! Yes, it is difficult, but this doesn't takeaway the fact that this is the most fascinating subject in the world. What could be better than learning about the building blocks that make up everything we touch and see, and the largest and most monstrous astronomical objects which shape meaning into our very own existence? Well, very few, if not none. But most people think physics is hard (yeah, right) and lame (Nooooo!). I trace this image to how physics is portrayed in basic education, and realize how lucky I was to have had the best teachers to know how this should be done.

Paving the road forward, especially for all the young guns in my beloved Philippines, I take it as a personal mission to always give the ones that come after the exquisite physics experience to tell.
