### As a Physics Teacher

Physics is fun! Yes, it is difficult, but this doesn't takeaway the fact that this is the most fascinating subject in the world. What could be better than learning about the building blocks (atoms) that make up everything we touch and see, and the largest and most monstrous objects (black holes) which shape meaning into our very own existence? Well, very few, if not none. But most people think physics is hard (yeah, right) and lame (Nooooo!), and I trace this image to how physics is instructed in high school and college. I was lucky enough to have had the best teachers to know how this should be done, and I take it as a personal mission to give the ones that come after the exquisite physics experience.
