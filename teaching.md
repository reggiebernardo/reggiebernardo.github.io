### As a Physics Teacher

Physics is one of the most fascinating subjects in the world. It's the study of the building blocks that make up everything we touch and see, as well as the largest and most monstrous astronomical objects that shape our very existence. Unfortunately, many people think that physics is difficult and boring. I believe this is due to how physics is often portrayed in basic education, but it doesn't have to be that way.

When I was learning physics, I was fortunate to have had some of the best teachers who knew how to make the subject come alive. They didn't just explain the concepts; they also provided real-world examples and engaged us in hands-on experiments. It was through their guidance that I learned to appreciate the beauty and elegance of physics.

I understand that many people find physics challenging, but it's not impossible to understand. By breaking down complex ideas into simpler components and explaining them in relatable terms, anyone can grasp the fundamental concepts of physics. Moreover, by highlighting the practical applications of physics in our everyday lives, we can help others see the subject's relevance and importance.

As someone who has benefited greatly from learning physics, I feel it's my personal mission to share this passion with others, especially young people in the Philippines. I want to give them the same exquisite physics experience that I had and help them see that physics is not just a subject but a way of understanding the world around us.
