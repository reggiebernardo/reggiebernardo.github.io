Hi, Reggie here. I hail from Calamba City, Philippines, where I went to high school and the seminary. I chased physics after this.

I received much of my scientific training (BS 2015, MS 2017, PhD 2020) from the prestigious [National Institute of Physics](http://nip.upd.edu.ph/) at the [University of the Philippines](https://upd.edu.ph/).
During this time, I was lucky enough to have been guided under the wing of [Perry Esguerra](http://nip.upd.edu.ph/profiles/jose-perico-esguerra/) and later by [Ian Vega](https://ianvega.wixsite.com/ianvega/about) when I joined the [Gravity Group](https://gravity-nip.github.io/).
I was awarded my doctoral degree in 2020 (read more [here](https://www.flipscience.ph/news/features-news/features/reginald-bernardo-gravitational-physicist/), [here](https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/06/07/20/beyond-einstein-a-young-pinoy-physicist-shines-light-on-black-holes-dark-energy), [here](https://news.abs-cbn.com/ancx/culture/spotlight/06/21/20/the-first-pinoy-gravitational-physicist-on-whats-keeping-scientists-here-from-achieving-greater-heights), and [here](http://davaotoday.com/main/economy/education/a-hope-for-science-community-as-up-alum-becomes-phls-first-gravitational-physicist/), among others).
Currently, I am a postdoc in Taiwan at the [Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica](https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/index.php).

Outside of physics, I like simply long chats about anything, while drinking. I play chess and basketball, and time to time go hiking. But above all, I love to spend time watching movies, series (shoutout to Mr. Robot fans), and anime.

All time best: Whiplash (Movie), Mr. Robot (TV Series), The Office US (Sitcom), FMA Brotherhood (Anime).
