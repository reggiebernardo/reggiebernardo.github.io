Hi. I'm Reggie. Cosmologist.

This website shares my scientific journey and stuff that I pick up along the way that I want to share. So please view my [research](./research.html) whenever you feel so and use any material ([notebooks](https://github.com/reggiebernardo/notebooks), readings, whatsoever) you find in my website however you want. Enjoy, and don't hesitate to send me an email anytime!

Have a great day!
